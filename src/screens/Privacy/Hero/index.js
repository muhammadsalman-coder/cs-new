                      well as to provide website usage information to the

                      function to Cookies, that are used to track online

                      stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are
                      embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us
                      to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and
                      they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure
                      that we are sending only messages that are of interest to
                      our users. We may use this information to reduce or
                      eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the
                      information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal
                      Data.

              Your Legal Rights
              <p class="css-lur2ps">
                Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data
                protection laws in relation to your Personal Data. Depending on
                your location and subject to applicable law, you may have the
                following rights with regard to the Personal Data we collect
                about you:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The right to request access to your Personal Data (commonly
                  known as a <strong>“data subject access request”</strong>).
                  This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we
                  hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing
                  it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The right to request that ChainCollection rectifies or updates
                  Personal Data that we hold about you that is inaccurate,
                  incomplete or outdated. However, we may need to verify the
                  accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The right to request that ChainCollection erase your Personal
                  Data in certain circumstances provided by law. This enables
                  you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is
                  no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have
                  the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data
                  where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
                  processing (see below), where we may have processed your
                  information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
                  Personal Data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we
                  may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure
                  for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if
                  applicable, at the time of your request.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The right to object to ChainCollection processing your
                  Personal Data where we are relying on a legitimate interest
                  (or those of a third party) and there is something about your
                  particular situation which makes you want to object to
                  processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
                  fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
                  object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct
                  marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we
                  have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information
                  which override your rights and freedoms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The right to request that ChainCollection restrict the usage
                  or processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances.
                  This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
                  Personal Data in scenarios such as: if you want us to
                  establish the data’s accuracy; where our use of the data is
                  unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; where you need us
                  to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need
                  it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or you have
                  objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether
                  we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The right to request that ChainCollection export, if
                  technically and legally feasible, your Personal Data that we
                  hold in service to another company or to you. We will provide
                  to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data
                  in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note
                  that this right only applies to automated information which
                  you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used
                  the information to perform a contract with you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The right to withdraw consent at any time where we are relying
                  on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will
                  not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before
                  you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we
                  may not be able to provide certain products or services to
                  you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you
                  withdraw your consent.

              <p class="css-lur2ps">
                If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, you may
                contact ChainCollection as described in section 1.3 above. We
                take each request seriously, and will comply with your request
                to the extent required by applicable law. We will not be able to
                respond to a request if we no longer hold your Personal Data.

              <p class="css-lur2ps">
                Please note that the Service employs smart contracts that
                collect information that is then stored on a blockchain that we
                do not control. If you use the Service, you are consenting to
                allow your information to be cryptographically transmitted and
                stored on that blockchain, and any deletion or modification of
                that information (to the extent possible on a blockchain) is
                governed by the terms of the relevant smart contract.
              </p>
              No Fee Usually Required
              <p class="css-lur2ps">
                You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or
                to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
                reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive
                or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your
                request in these circumstances.
              </p>
              What We May Need from You
              <p class="css-lur2ps">
                For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before
                responding to your request to ensure your right to access your
                Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is
                a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed
                to any person who has no right to receive it. This may include
                verifying that the e-mail address from which you sent the
                request matches your e-mail address that we have on file. We may
                also contact you to ask you for further information in relation
                to your request to speed up our response.
              </p>
              Time Limit to Respond
              <p class="css-lur2ps">
                We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
                Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your
                request is particularly complex or you have made a number of
                requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

              Data Retention
              <p class="css-lur2ps">
                We may retain your Personal Data for as long as you continue to
                use the Service, have an account with us, or for as long as is
                reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for
                as outlined in this Privacy Policy. You can ask us to close your
                account by contacting us as described in section 1.3 above, and
                we will delete your Personal Data on request where the
                condition(s) is met (please see section 9 above for further
                information). We may, however, retain Personal Data for an
                additional period as is permitted or required under applicable
                laws, for legal, tax, regulatory, accounting or reporting
                reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes. We may
                also retain your Personal Data for a longer period in the event
                of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect
                of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
              </p>
              <p class="css-lur2ps">
                To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data,
                we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal
                Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or
                disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we
                process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those
                purposes through other means, and the applicable legal,
                regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
              </p>
              <p class="css-lur2ps">
                In some circumstances we will anonymize your Personal Data (so
                that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or
                statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information
                indefinitely without further notice to you.

                accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. However,
                no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the
                security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information
                under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of
                security, we will take steps to investigate the situation and,
                where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information
                may have been compromised and take other steps in accordance
                with any applicable laws and regulations.

                Hong Kong, European Economic Area (<strong>“EEA”</strong>)

                information in the country to which your information is
                transferred may be different from those in the country in which
                you live. For example, the circumstances in which law
                enforcement can access personal information may vary from
                country to country. In particular, if your information is in
                Hong Kong, it may be accessed by government authorities in
