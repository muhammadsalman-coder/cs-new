                    Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique, digital items with
                    blockchain-managed ownership. Examples of NFTs include
                    digital art, collectibles, virtual reality items, crypto
                    domain names, ownership records for physical assets, and
                    more. Don't get overwhelmed by the idea of fungibility, it's
                    just the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with
                    other individual goods or assets of the same type.

                        ETH stand for Ethereum, a digital currency which powers
                        the transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain. ETH
                        currency mints and purchases your NFTs and pays for gas
                        fees (transaction fees) which complete the transaction.

                      <p>
                        A crypto wallet works as both a wallet and debit card.
                        It store your digital currency, i.e. Ethereum, and
                        processes transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
                        Closed Sea is only a means to interact with others on
                        the blockchain, where as a crypto wallet helps translate
                        your actions into transaction on the blockchain. Each
                        wallet has a unique wallet address which you will use to
                        complete the transactions. <br />
                        Your transaction record is available on etherscan.io. It
                        is recommended to check Etherscan after each
                        transaction.

                      Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with

                      is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.
                      ETH is used to pay transaction fees (known as gas fees) on
                      the Ethereum blockchain. ClosedSea has no say in setting
                      gas fees – they are determined by supply/demand and
                      fluctuate according to network usage.

                      Polygon is a separate blockchain that provides scalable,
                      secure and instant transactions with Ethereum currencies
                      like ETH, USDC and DAI. From July, 2021, users can use
